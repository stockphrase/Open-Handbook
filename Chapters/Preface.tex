\chapter{Preface}

College students are commonly required to purchase handbooks for use in their
writing courses. These reference texts introduce students to the conventions of
academic writing and often include chapters on academic research, critical
thinking, grammar, and formal citation.

The knowledge contained in these texts is indispensable. However, most handbooks
on the market today are bloated in both content and price (I think the former
is often the justification for the latter). For example, the institution where I
formerly worked required students to purchase a handbook that was over 900 pages
long and cost around \$60. I think that is too long and too much.

My goal for this project is to create a brief handbook with everything students
need to successfully navigate their college writing assignments, then give it
away for free.\medskip
