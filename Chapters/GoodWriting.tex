\chapter{What is Good Writing?}


Academic writing takes many forms. However, all \emph{good} academic writing shares several basic characteristics:

\begin{itemize}

\item Good academic writing always contains a \hloy{strong thesis statement}: an idea, stated as an assertion, that is the work's central focus.
\item Good academic writing is \hloy{organized}: each \hyperlink{organization}{\color{Ahrenge}{paragraph}} builds upon the one before it, creating a strong sense of purpose. The paragraphs themselves are unified, generally pursuing a single idea that helps support the \hloy{thesis}. Each paragraph should use a strong \hyperlink{organization}{\color{Ahrenge}{topic sentence}} that clearly indicates the subject of the paragraph.
\item Good academic writing has \hloy{elegant and logical transitions} between paragraphs and ideas.
\item Good academic writing shows an awareness of the needs of its particular \hyperlink{audience}{\color{Ahrenge}{audience}} by contextualizing the ideas, texts, authors, debates, or histories that are discussed within it.
\item Good academic writing is \hloy{relevant, useful, and interesting} to its imagined \hyperlink{audience}{\color{Ahrenge}{audience}}.
\item Good academic writing \hloy{skillfully uses evidence} to support claims and it \hyperlink{sources}{\color{Ahrenge}{properly credits outside sources with citations}}.
\item Good academic writing is \hloy{precise, clear, and concise}.

\end{itemize}
